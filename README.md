# Overview

An extremely simple example to demonstrate dependency injection pattern in .NET for my blog.

A console application that starts up, and prints a single message on the screen based on the configured DI services.

## Running

Just go into the Honlsoft.Examples.DependencyInjection folder and run ```dotnet run```.
